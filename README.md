# Bacteria-Infectious-Disease-Ontology
The Bacteria Infectious Disease Ontology is an extension of IDO that will serve as a reference ontology concerning bacterial pathogens. In turn it will serve as a hub for IDO extensions concerning specific bacterial infectious diseases. It mirrors the Virus Infectious Disease Ontology in that respect.
